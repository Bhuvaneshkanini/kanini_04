      <h2>Motivation </h2>
      <p>Nobody in the world is same. One might be good at one thing and bad at the other while the other person might be the exact opposite. Similarly, when at times, you lack the most essential thing in life that keeps you going; the other person might be full of it. I know, you’ve got me; yes, I am talking about Motivation. In this never ending rat race, we do get frustrated and lose all hopes every now and then. We feel like we have nothing left to work for. When everything seems to go to the left, and all the doors to the right get shut; that’s when you need the help of people like Counsellors or I’d rather suggest, motivational bloggers. Yes, the ones who are full of what you lack will definitely provide you with the will to continue moving. They will help you get up and open all the doors to the right. All you need is to realize that all that you have to do is NOW, cause sometimes NOW becomes NEVER and that’s when you regret. No!! You can’t afford to regret at any time in your life. Never!I like to explore all the domains and i like to be one of the best Software Engineer    </p>
      
      <h5>It doesn’t matter how hard something seems; nothing is impossible unless one believes it to be so.</h5>
      <p> So get out there, face your fears head-on, be courageous and stretch yourself because anything in life worth having does NOT come easy! – Unknown Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm.</p>
