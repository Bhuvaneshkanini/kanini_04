            lli, situated on the banks of the river Cauvery is the fourth largest city in Tamil Nadu. It was a citadel of the early Cholas which later fell to the Pallavas. Trichy is a fine blend of tradition and modernity built around the Rock Fort. Apart from the Fort, there are several Temples dating back to the 1760s. The town and its fort, now in Trichy were built by the Nayaks of Madurai. This District has given great scholars and leaders whose contributions to the society have been very significant.</p>
